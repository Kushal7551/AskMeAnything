    "Name": "Downy Mildew",
    "Description": "Downy mildew refers to any of several types of oomycete microbes that are obligate parasites of plants. Downy mildews exclusively belong to the Peronosporaceae family. In commercial agriculture, they are a particular problem for growers of crucifers, grapes, and vegetables that grow on vines.",
    "Symptoms": "Initial symptoms include large, angular or blocky, yellow areas visible on the upper surface. They can also be distinguished by their sporadic yellow patch appearance.",
    "Solutions": {
        "Cultural": "Because the downy mildew pathogen does not overwinter in midwestern fields, crop rotations and tillage practices do not affect disease development. The pathogen tends to become established in late summer. Therefore, planting early season varieties may further reduce the already minor threat posed by downy mildew.",
        "Chemical": [
            "Copper is at least somewhat effective in protecting against downy mildew infection.",
            "Oxathiapiprolin is effective for use against downy mildew.",
            "A mixture of zoxamide and mancozeb was registered for control of the mildew.",
        ],
        "Organic": "Control of downy mildew is to eliminate moisture and humidity around the impacted plants.",

    "Symptoms": "The foliage of affected tomato plants shows mottling, with alternating yellowish and darker green areas, the latter often appearing thicker and raised giving a blister-like appearance. The leaves tend to be fern-like in appearance with pointed tips, and younger leaves may be twisted.",
